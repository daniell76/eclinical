7. RI/CPP discount % is based on 24x31=744 hours/month, however in Excel 730 hours/month is used?
    A: for RI/CPP discount percentage, the actual cost shall be based on 744 hours/month, i.e.
        PAYG Monthly Cost = 730 x hourly rate
        RI/CPP Monthly Cost = 744 x (1-discount%) x hourly rate
